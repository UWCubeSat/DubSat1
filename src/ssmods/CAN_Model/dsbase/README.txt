This folder is actually only the physical folder into which the VIRTUAL folders that make up dsbase are mapped by the CCS/Eclipse project files.  In general, NO "REAL" FILES SHOULD BE PLACED IN THIS DIRECTORY.  Note that this file, in addition to explaining the purpose of this directory, also "pins" the directory in place in Git (otherwise, it looks empty to Git and is removed, thus breaking project files on other machines).
