 *                       MSP432 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP432 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see http://www.ti.com/tool/mspdriverlib for an API functional
 * library & https://dev.ti.com/pinmux/ for a GUI approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP432P401 Demo - Timer0_A3, Toggle P1.0, CCR0 Cont Mode ISR, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and TA_0 ISR. Timer0_A is
//  configured for continuous mode, thus the timer overflows when TAR counts
//  to CCR0. In this example, CCR0 is loaded with 50000.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = TACLK = default DCO = ~3MHz
