COMMAND EPS_DIST COMMONCMD LITTLE_ENDIAN "Provides commands that are common to all the MSP43x modules."

  # TO CUSTOMIZE FOR A GIVEN TARGET:  change expmod, below; all other params should 
  # stay as they are
  
  # This must ALWAYS be the first entry in any command packet
  # In this case, not that the entity ID is 2 = routes to the debug service itself (NOT any subsystem-specific code)
  <%= render "../../SYSTEM/cmd_tlm/_shared_cmd_header.txt", locals: { eid: 2, opc: 0 } %>
  
  # The rest of the fields are the actual commands passed
  # expmod = specifies the expected module (via setting the min/max/default value) - should match
  # the correct module's value in _shared_mod_ids.txt
