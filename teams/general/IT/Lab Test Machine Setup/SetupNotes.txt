This document captures the list of software required to build up a Windows lab/test machine for the HSL, based on current plans.  The latest version of Windows 10 is assumed, as well as the latest version of each of the software packages listed below (unless otherwise noted.)

Software to Install for the Internets:

* MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html):  a number of toolboxes are assumed as well - the best route is to use a copy purchased through the UW 30$-for-everything program (http://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/uware/matlab/), which includes practically everything Mathworks makes.
	* There are also a substantial pile of "hardware support packages" that might or might not be useful for a given lab machine, depending on the sorts of hardware it will be interfacing with, and how much MATLAB will be used (vs., say, COSMOS).  We will list the appropriate choices here (TBD)

* COSMOS (http://cosmosrb.com/):  The main guts of our testing and operations apparatus.  Helpful batch file install for Windows works perfectly; other operating systems slightly less so.  Installs the core framework, a demonstration environment with simulated targets/instruments, and a full Ruby installation (needed for all things Ruby).  Note that following the instructions on cosmosrb.com for UPDGRADING the installation later on often doesn't work exaclty was prescribed - please talk to HSL IT for help with that.

* SourceTree (https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/):  the blessed Git client for the lab.  Not perfect, but lots of folks use it and can help each other.  For official lab machines, please use the HSL/UWCubesat credentials - contact HSL IT for details.  If you are comfortable with another client - or no client - then that's fine, but know that IT and fellow teammates are less likely able to help you if Things Go Bad (tm).

* Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/):  one of the better ways to get Python and all the interesting libraries on a Windows machine.  

* Rigol's Instrument Interface Software/Drivers "Ultra Sigma" (http://beyondmeasure.rigoltech.com/acton/attachment/1579/u-0003/0/-/-/-/-/):  This must be installed to get the core drivers and app for doing directly interfacing with Rigol interfaces.  The main UI is NOT used by the HSL test infrastructure (except during development, to troubleshoot SCPI command sequences, etc.), but the drivers are required - plus the UI can sometimes be helpful finding the "full name" of a given instrument over LAN or USB.
