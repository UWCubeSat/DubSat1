Below are the current peripheral and pin assignments for the MSP430's in their various test configurations/boards.  While the 80-pin "PN" package is used on the MSP430FR5994 LaunchPad dev boards, we are currently planning to use (and all test boards are indeed using) the smaller, 64-pin "PM" package.  The main difference between the two is the number of eUSCI peripherals exposed - the larger package has 4 each of A and B eUSCI peripherals, while the flight choice, PM, has only 3 of each.  Therefore, unless an application is definitively meant for ONLY a LaunchPad, A3 and B3 eUSCI unit usage should be avoided.

eUSCI Peripherals (A blocks = UART/SPI/Irda, B blocks =SPI/I2C)
- A0:  Backchannel UART
- A1:  Application UART
- A2:  SPI (and therefore CAN)
- A3:  *** DOES NOT EXIST ON FLIGHT PACKAGE (PM), only available on LauchPad board ***

- B0:  
- B1:  
- B2:  I2C
- B3:  *** DOES NOT EXIST ON FLIGHT PACKAGE (PM), only available on LauchPad board ***

Timer Blocks:
- A0 (3 CCRs):  Main timer driving BDot controller >>> let's use this for any timers needed for subsystem-specific use
- A1 (3 CCRs):  
- A2 (2 CCRs):  
- A3 (2 CCRs):
- A4 (2 CCRs): 

- B0 (7(!!) CCRs) - Reserved for PWM on boards that need it (MTQ, RWs)
